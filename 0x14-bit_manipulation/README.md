1) Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

2) Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned 

3) Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);

4) Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

5) Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

6) Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);

7) Write a function that checks the endianness.

Prototype: int get_endianness(void);
Returns: 0 if big endian, 1 if little endian
